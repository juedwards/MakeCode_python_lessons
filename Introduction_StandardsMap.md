## üéØ Mapping to U.S. Middle School Curriculum

### üß© Standards Alignment

#### ‚úÖ CSTA (Computer Science Teachers Association) Standards (Grades 6‚Äì8)

| CSTA Standard Code | What It Covers                                           | How Your Lessons Align                                                                              |
| ------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1B-AP-08**       | Compare and refine multiple algorithms for the same task | Students explore different solutions for the same build task, e.g., `for` loops vs. manual commands |
| **1B-AP-09**       | Create programs that use variables and functions         | Functions like `build_walls()` teach structured thinking and abstraction                            |
| **1B-AP-10**       | Use loops, conditionals, and logic in programs           | Loops (`for`), conditionals (`if row % 2 == 0`), and logical thinking are core to building patterns |
| **1B-AP-11**       | Decompose problems and create sub-solutions              | Students break larger build challenges (like walls + roof) into steps                               |
| **1B-AP-12**       | Modify and run programs to improve or customize          | The lessons include remixable code that students can extend (e.g., change size or block types)      |
| **1B-AP-15**       | Test and debug (identify and fix errors) in a program    | Students naturally debug by seeing incorrect Agent behavior and adjusting code                      |
| **1B-CS-01**       | Describe how computing devices work together             | Minecraft + MakeCode environment helps visualize how coding interfaces with simulations             |

### üåç ISTE (International Society for Technology in Education) Student Standards

| ISTE Standard                 | How It Applies                                                                       |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1.1 Empowered Learner**     | Students take charge of learning through interactive builds                          |
| **1.4 Innovative Designer**   | Learners use Agent-based construction as a design challenge                          |
| **1.5 Computational Thinker** | Students use algorithmic thinking to solve spatial and structural problems           |
| **1.6 Creative Communicator** | Extension tasks allow students to personalize and present their code-based creations |

## üè´ How It Fits in a Middle School CS Course

| Unit or Skill            | How This Resource Supports It                                            |
| ------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Intro to Python**      | Introduces text-based coding gently using familiar Minecraft context     |
| **Algorithmic Thinking** | Reinforces how loops and conditionals automate building tasks            |
| **Game-based Learning**  | Keeps engagement high and builds motivation through creativity           |
| **Math Integration**     | Supports geometry and arithmetic (area, perimeter, sequences)            |
| **Creative Design**      | Students can plan, prototype, and build structures using logic           |
| **Collaboration**        | Lessons can be paired with pair programming or class-wide build projects |

### üß† Bonus: Differentiation for Diverse Learners

* **Accessible to beginners** through scaffolding and visual feedback
* **Advanced learners** can expand tasks: build mazes, automate farms, or implement redstone logic
* **Cross-curricular potential** for integration with math, geography, design & technology
