## **Lesson 10 – Read and Write Files with the Agent**

### 🔍 **Overview**

In this lesson, students will explore how to use the new file read/write features in MakeCode for Minecraft Education. They will create a `.txt` or `.csv` file that stores instructions, and then program the Agent to read those instructions and perform actions like moving, collecting, or building.

This is a great introduction to how computers store and interpret data from files, supporting foundational computer science concepts like I/O operations, parsing, and simple state machines.

### 🎯 **Learning Objectives**

* Understand how to write to and read from `.txt` and `.csv` files using MakeCode Python.
* Learn how to control the Minecraft Agent based on file contents.
* Practice using conditional logic and loops to perform actions based on external data.

---

### 🧰 **Required Setup**

* Minecraft Education Preview 1.22 or later
* Windows device (feature not currently supported on Chromebook)
* A known writable file path, such as:
  `C:/Users/<your name>/Desktop/agent_instructions.txt`

---

### 🧪 **Task 1 – Write Commands to a File**

Open MakeCode in Python mode in your Minecraft world and enter:

```python
def on_chat():
    file.write_file("C:/Users/<your name>/Desktop/agent_instructions.txt",
        "forward,3\nturn_left,1\nplace_block,GRASS\nbackward,2")
    player.say("Instruction file written!")

player.on_chat("write", on_chat)
```

💡 *This writes a CSV-like list of instructions for the Agent: move, turn, place, etc.*

---

### 🧪 **Task 2 – Read File and Execute Instructions**

Now read the file and parse the lines:

```python
def on_chat_read():
    path = "C:/Users/<your name>/Desktop/agent_instructions.txt"
    data = file.read_file(path)
    commands = data.split("\n")

    for line in commands:
        parts = line.split(",")
        if len(parts) == 2:
            cmd = parts[0]
            value = int(parts[1])

            if cmd == "forward":
                for i in range(value):
                    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
            elif cmd == "backward":
                for i in range(value):
                    agent.move(BACK, 1)
            elif cmd == "turn_left":
                for i in range(value):
                    agent.turn(LEFT_TURN)
            elif cmd == "place_block":
                agent.place(BLOCK_FACE_FORWARD)

    player.say("Agent followed the file!")

player.on_chat("read", on_chat_read)
```

🧠 **Challenge**: Modify the file to try different instructions, or add your own! Can you get the agent to build a staircase or dig a trench?

---

### 🛠 **Extension Ideas**

* Use `.csv` files with coordinates to build custom structures.
* Save player-collected stats (like item count) into a log file.
* Create an "agent diary" that logs actions taken during gameplay.

---

### ⚠️ **Known Limitations**

* Make sure the file path is valid and the folder exists.
* You cannot append to files — every write replaces the old data.
* This currently does **not** work on Chromebooks.
* Only folders your user has access to can be used.
