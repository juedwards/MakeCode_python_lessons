## 🎯 Learning Objectives:

By the end of this unit, educators will be able to:

* Install and launch Minecraft Education on student devices
* Sign in with valid school accounts
* Enable MakeCode for Python coding
* Prepare learning worlds for student activities
* Troubleshoot access issues or errors

---

## ✅ Step-by-Step Setup Guide

### 1. **Install Minecraft Education**

* Download Minecraft Education from the official site:
  🔗 [https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/get-started/download](https://education.minecraft.net/en-us/get-started/download)
* Install on all student and teacher devices (Windows, Mac, iPad, or Chromebook).

### 2. **Sign In with Microsoft 365 for Education**

* Students and teachers must use a valid school-provided Microsoft 365 Education account.
* Check eligibility here:

> **Tip:** Test sign-in on at least one student device before your first class.

---

### 3. **Enable Python Coding via MakeCode**

* Launch Minecraft Education and create or open a world.
* Press **“C”** on the keyboard to open the **Code Builder**.
* Select **MakeCode** as your coding platform.
* Choose **Python** from the available language options.

> **Note:** Some school-managed devices may restrict this. Make sure MakeCode services are not blocked by firewalls or policies.

---

### 4. **Prepare Minecraft Worlds for Learning**

* Use pre-built lesson worlds inside Minecraft Education:

* Go to **Library > Subject Kits > Computer Science** for starter worlds.
* Enable **Multiplayer** in game settings if students will collaborate on builds.

> **Tip:** Use structured worlds that limit distractions for younger learners, especially in early units.

### 5. **Review IT Admin Requirements**

* Share this IT Admin Guide with your school’s tech lead:
  
  🔗 [Minecraft Education IT Admin FAQ](https://edusupport.minecraft.net/hc/en-us/articles/360047118992-FAQ-IT-Admin-Guide)

* Key admin setup includes:

  * Allowlisting domains and ports for Minecraft Education
  * Ensuring access to MakeCode services via HTTPS
  * Verifying student licenses through Microsoft 365 Admin Center

> **Admin checklist:**
> ✅ Minecraft Education installed
> ✅ MakeCode enabled
> ✅ Sign-in verified
> ✅ Required domains allowlisted

---

## 🧰 Troubleshooting Tips

* **Can’t sign in?** Check the student’s M365 license, internet, and firewall settings.
* **Code Builder not launching?** Restart Minecraft or check keyboard shortcut (**“C” key**).
* **MakeCode not appearing?** Ensure the device has internet access and no network blocks on `makecode.com`.
