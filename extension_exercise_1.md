## üß± Unit 7 Extension: Build a 5x5 Agent Wall House

If you've completed all the units to this point, you're ready to start putting it all together and create some useful minecraft stuctures. 

**What you will make:**
In this challenge, you will program the Agent to build **four tall walls** in a square shape ‚Äî like the walls of a small stone house!

### üéØ What you will learn:

* How to use **loops** inside loops - We did that in **unit 5**
* How to make the Agent **build upwards**
* How to build a **square wall structure** using code

---

### üîß Step-by-step Instructions

#### 1. Start with this code:

Paste the code below into MakeCode and run the `wall` command in the chat.

```python
# Chat command to build a 5x5 square enclosure
def build_walls():
    agent.teleport_to_player()
    agent.set_assist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, True)
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    agent.set_slot(1)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.move(LEFT, 1)

    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)

    for layer in range(5):  # This makes the walls 5 blocks high
        for side in range(4):  # This makes the Agent go around the square
            agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
            agent.turn_right()
        agent.move(UP, 1)  # After each square, go up 1 block

player.on_chat("wall", build_walls)
```

### üß† What is happening?

Let‚Äôs break it down:

* `agent.teleport_to_player()`: The Agent comes to you.
* `agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)`: The Agent gets 64 stone blocks.
* `for layer in range(5)`: This builds the wall **five blocks high**.
* `for side in range(4)`: This tells the Agent to build **all four sides** of the square.
* `agent.move(UP, 1)`: After each layer, the Agent moves up to build the next level!

### üí° Challenge: Make it your own!

Try one or more of these ideas:

‚úÖ Add a **roof** using another `for` loop.

```python
# Chat command to build a 5x5 square enclosure with a roof
def build_walls():
    agent.teleport_to_player()
    agent.set_assist(DESTROY_OBSTACLES, True)
    agent.set_item(STONE, 64, 1)
    agent.set_slot(1)
    agent.move(FORWARD, 1)
    agent.move(LEFT, 1)

    agent.set_assist(PLACE_ON_MOVE, True)

    # Build 5x5 walls, 5 blocks high
    for layer in range(5):
        for side in range(4):
            agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
            agent.turn_right()
        agent.move(UP, 1)

    for row in range(5):
        agent.move(FORWARD, 5)
        if row % 2 == 1:
            agent.turn(TurnDirection.LEFT)
        else:
            agent.turn(TurnDirection.RIGHT)
        agent.move(FORWARD,1)
        if row % 2 == 1:
            agent.turn(TurnDirection.LEFT)
        else:
            agent.turn(TurnDirection.RIGHT)

player.on_chat("wall", build_walls)

```
Copy and paste this code to your editor and press RUN. It shuold build a simple 5x5 house with a roof.

### üîç What‚Äôs New?

* The **roof** is built using two nested loops:

  * `row` loop moves across each row.
  * `col` loop places 5 blocks in each row.
  * At the end of each row, the Agent **zig-zags** to the next row.
* The Agent **ends up on top** of the wall before building the roof.

### üî¢ What does `%` mean?

```python
row % 2
```

This checks whether `row` is **even** or **odd**.

* If `row % 2 == 0`: the number is **even** (like 0, 2, 4)
* If `row % 2 == 1`: the number is **odd** (like 1, 3, 5)

---

### ü§ñ Why use `%` in this code?

You're using it to **zigzag** the Agent across the roof:

```python
if row % 2 == 1:
    agent.turn(TurnDirection.LEFT)
else:
    agent.turn(TurnDirection.RIGHT)
```

This pattern makes the Agent:

* Turn **left** at the end of **odd-numbered rows**
* Turn **right** at the end of **even-numbered rows**

This way, the Agent moves:

* Forward across one row,
* Turns,
* Moves down to the next row,
* Then moves back across in the opposite direction ‚Äî like a typewriter!

---

### üß† Simple Analogy:

Imagine mowing the lawn in straight lines:

* You go across one row,
* Turn around,
* Come back the other way.
  That‚Äôs what the `%` is helping the Agent do!

---

### üìù Reflection

* What happens if you remove the `agent.move(UP, 1)` line?
* How would you make the walls **longer** or **taller**?
